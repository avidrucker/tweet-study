# Tweet Study

![This is what the demo currently looks like.](https://github.com/avidrucker/tweet-study/blob/master/tweet_study_screenshot.png)

A demo of React components simply built.

Inspired by [Dave Ceddia's React Course](https://daveceddia.com/pure-react/).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). See link for build and run instructions.
